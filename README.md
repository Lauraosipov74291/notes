- "Programming wisdom for today: Write code that is easy to understand and maintain. This means using clear and descriptive variable names, commenting your code thoroughly, and organizing your code in a logical and consistent manner. Remember, you may not be the only person who will ever need to read or modify your code, so make it as user-friendly as possible."
